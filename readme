A 5x5 font mean for embedding in a c header. It is available in normal mode,
where each character is an array of 25 chars (1 or 0), or in a minimal mode,
where each character is represented as a 32-bit number.

The font itself is defined in font.txt. If you make changes to it, you can
re-generate the headers using conv.um. The parse function is exported, so you
can make your own translation targets.

I'm happy to take contributions, whether it improves the conversion script, or
improves some of the glyphs (some of them aren't that good).
